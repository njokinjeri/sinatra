### 🎶 Sinatra project

A simple and elegant 2D CSS replication of a Harman Kardon speaker that plays Frank & Nancy Sinatra's "Something Stupid".


#### 📻 Inspiration

This project blends aesthetic design, nostalgic audio, and creative front-end magic. 

Built just for the vibe - because not everything needs a reason beyond being beautiful and fun.
